It also imports other components that are used throughout the application.\n2. `patient-list.component.ts`: This file defines a reusable component that displays a list of patients. The component takes in an array of patient objects as input and displays their names, ages, medical conditions, and medical histories.\n3. `patient-details.component.ts`: This file defines another reusable component that displays detailed information about a single patient. The component takes in a patient object as input and displays its name, age, medical condition, and medical history.\n4. `add-patient.component.ts`: This file defines a component for adding new patients to the system. The component has a form that allows users to enter the patient's name, age, medical condition, and medical history.\n5. `edit-patient.component.ts`: This file defines another reusable component that allows users to edit existing patients in the system. The component has a form that allows users to update the patient's information.\n6. `delete-patient.component.ts`: This file defines a component for deleting patients from the system. The component displays a confirmation dialog asking if the user is sure they want to delete the patient.\n7. `app-routing.module.ts`: This file defines the routes in the application and how they should be handled by the router. It also imports other routing modules that define additional routes.\n8. `material-theme.scss`: This file defines the theme of the application, which includes colors, typography, and layout styles. It uses SASS syntax to make it easier to customize the theme.\n9. `app.module.ts`: This file defines the root module of the application, which imports all other modules and provides configuration for the app's routing system.\n\nOverall, this is a well-structured Angular application that uses reusable components and modular design patterns to make it easier to maintain and update.",
