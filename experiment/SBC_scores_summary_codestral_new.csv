This application manages the state of pets in a store, which allows components to retrieve and update pet data. Here's a high-level overview of what each part does:

1. `pet.model.ts` defines the Pet interface, which is used throughout the application.
2. `pet.service.ts` provides methods for communicating with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on pets.
3. `pet.actions.ts` exports action creator functions that create actions which describe events in the application. These actions are dispatched to the store and can be handled by reducers or effects.
4. `pet.effects.ts` uses the @ngrx/effects package to handle side-effects, such as making API calls. When an action is dispatched that matches one of the provided cases (loadPets, createPet, updatePet, deletePet), it makes the appropriate API call and then dispatches a success or failure action based on the result.
5. `pet.reducer.ts` defines how the state in the store changes in response to actions. It uses the @ngrx/entity package to provide helper functions for working with entities, such as adding, updating, and removing pets from the state. The reducer function handles different cases (loadPetsSuccess, createPetSuccess, updatePetSuccess, deletePetSuccess) and returns a new state object based on the current state and the dispatched action.
6. `pet.selectors.ts` exports functions that can be used to select specific pieces of data from the store. These selectors are used by components to retrieve pet data for display or update.
7. `app.module.ts`, `app.component.ts`, and other component files are not shown here, but they would typically import the PetModule (which exports the PetService, PetActions, etc.), provide it in the appropriate injectors, and use selectors to retrieve and display pet data.

You've covered all the essential components such as Actions, Reducers, Effects, Services, and Components which are critical in building a robust and efficient web application.

The use of Ngrx provides clear separation of concerns and improved testability for our components. The state management via reducers ensures that data updates are predictable and easier to debug.

Ngrx Effects is used to perform side effects such as API calls in an isolated, non-blocking manner which improves the performance of our application. This also makes it easy to test these side effects as they can be mocked out.

The use of RxJS operators such as `mergeMap`, `map`, and `catchError` provides powerful tools for managing asynchronous operations in a reactive and efficient manner. The use of SnackBar from Angular Material library is also beneficial in providing user feedback.
