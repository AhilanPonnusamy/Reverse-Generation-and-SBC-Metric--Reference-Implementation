        "reverse_generated_requirement": "This is a good start for your application, but there are still some things you can do to improve it. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Use the Angular CLI to generate the basic structure of your app. This will save you time and help you keep your code organized.\n2. Use the `ngIf` directive to conditionally display certain components based on user input or other conditions. This can help simplify your template files and make them easier to read.\n3. Consider using a more advanced layout system like CSS grid or flexbox instead of hardcoding the positioning of your components in the template. This will give you more control over the layout of your app and make it more responsive.\n4. Use the `ngFor` directive to iterate over lists of data and display them in a component. This can help simplify your code and make it easier to handle dynamic data.\n5. Consider using a state management system like NGRX or Ngxs to manage the state of your application. This will help you keep your components decoupled from each other and make it easier to test and maintain your app.\n6. Use the `ngx-translate` library to handle internationalization (i18n) in your app. This will help you support multiple languages and provide a more user-friendly experience for users who speak different languages.\n7. Consider using a service like Google Analytics or Segment to track user behavior and understand how your app is being used. This will give you valuable insights into how to improve the user experience and make data-driven decisions about the future of your app.",
