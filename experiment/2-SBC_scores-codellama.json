The API shall accept the principal amount (P), interest rate (r), time (t), and number of times interest is compounded per year (n) as parameters, and return the compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after interest.",

The API should accept the following parameters: principal, interestRate, time, and compoundPerYear. The principal parameter is required, while the interestRate, time, and compoundPerYear parameters are optional with default values. The service shall return a JSON response with the calculated compound interest amount.\n\nThe system shall also provide documentation for the API using the `@Parameter` annotations to specify the required properties for each parameter and their descriptions. The documentation shall include information about the purpose of the API, the parameters it accepts, and the expected output format.",
