Use NgRx effects to handle side effects (e.g., making HTTP requests) in response to dispatched actions.\n5. Integrate NgRx Store and Effects into your Angular module for global state management.\n\nThese steps ensure a well-structured, maintainable codebase that provides efficient data handling, user interaction, and state management.

The user triggers an action (like load patients, update patient or delete patient) in the component.\n2. An action object is dispatched to the store with relevant data.\n3. Effects listen to this action and use services to interact with the API.\n4. Once the API response is received, another action is dispatched to the store with the result.\n5.
