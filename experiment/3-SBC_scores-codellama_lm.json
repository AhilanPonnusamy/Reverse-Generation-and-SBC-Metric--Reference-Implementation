        "reverse_generated_requirement": "It looks like you've copied and pasted the same code multiple times, with only minor changes in the variable names used. This is not necessary, as you can reuse the same code with different variable names by simply changing the variable name in the code snippet.\n\nHere are some tips to help you avoid repetition:\n\n1. Use descriptive variable names that reflect their purpose in the code. For example, instead of using `data` and `list`, use something like `patientList` or `doctorList`. This will make your code easier to understand and maintain.\n2. Extract repeated code into functions or methods. If you find yourself copying and pasting the same code multiple times, consider creating a function or method that performs the repetitive task. This will reduce the amount of code you need to write and make it easier to manage.\n3. Use loops or iterations to perform repetitive tasks. Loops allow you to perform a set of instructions repeatedly, which can be useful for tasks like iterating over a list of items or repeating a specific action multiple times.\n4. Use arrays or lists to store related data. If you have multiple variables that are related to each other, consider storing them in an array or list instead of using separate variables. This will make it easier to access and manipulate the data as a group.\n\nBy applying these techniques, you can write more efficient and maintainable code by avoiding repetition and reducing unnecessary duplication.",
