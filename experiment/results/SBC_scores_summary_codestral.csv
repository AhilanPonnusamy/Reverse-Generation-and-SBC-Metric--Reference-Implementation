* `app.component.ts`: This file defines the root component of the application, which includes the HTML template and the TypeScript logic. The component also provides a service to communicate with the backend.
* `family-members.service.ts`: This file defines the service that will be used to communicate with the backend. It provides methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting family members.
* `family-members.ts`: This file defines the interface for the family member objects. It includes properties such as id, name, age, gender, and relationship.
* `family-members.model.ts`: This file provides a model class that can be used to represent the family members in the frontend. It includes methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting family members.

2. `patient-list.component.ts`: This file defines a reusable component that displays a list of patients. The component takes in an array of patient objects as input and displays their names, ages, medical conditions, and medical histories.
3. `patient-details.component.ts`: This file defines another reusable component that displays detailed information about a single patient. The component takes in a patient object as input and displays its name, age, medical condition, and medical history.
4. `add-patient.component.ts`: This file defines a component for adding new patients to the system. The component has a form that allows users to enter the patient's name, age, medical condition, and medical history.
5. `edit-patient.component.ts`: This file defines another reusable component that allows users to edit existing patients in the system. The component has a form that allows users to update the patient's information.
6. `delete-patient.component.ts`: This file defines a component for deleting patients from the system. The component displays a confirmation dialog asking if the user is sure they want to delete the patient.
7. `app-routing.module.ts`: This file defines the routes in the application and how they should be handled by the router. It also imports other routing modules that define additional routes.
8. `material-theme.scss`: This file defines the theme of the application, which includes colors, typography, and layout styles. It uses SASS syntax to make it easier to customize the theme.
9. `app.module.ts`: This file defines the root module of the application, which imports all other modules and provides configuration for the app's routing system.
