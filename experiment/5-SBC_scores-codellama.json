It uses the `PatientService` to fetch data from the server and display it in a table format.\n4. `patient-detail.component.ts`: This is another child component of `app.component.ts` that displays detailed information about a patient. It also uses the `PatientService` to fetch data from the server and display it in a form format.\n5. `services/patient.service.ts`: This is a service file that provides methods for fetching, adding, updating, and deleting patients. It uses the `HttpClient` module to make HTTP requests to the server.\n6. `services/patient.model.ts`: This is a model file that defines the structure of the patient data returned by the server. It includes properties such as `id`, `name`, `age`, and `medicalHistory`.\n7. `app-routing.module.ts`: This is a routing module file that defines routes for navigating between views in the application. It also provides default routes for handling unknown or unmatched URLs.\n8. `environment.ts`: This is an environment configuration file that sets up variables and constants for different environments, such as development, production, or testing.\n9. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file of the application that contains the top-level structure and layout of the application's views. It also loads JavaScript files and CSS stylesheets.\n10. `styles.css`: This is a stylesheet file that defines the style rules for the application, such as colors, fonts, and layout.\n\nOverall, this project demonstrates how to build a simple CRUD (create, read, update, delete) application using Angular and TypeScript. It includes a patient list view, patient detail view, and services for fetching and manipulating patient data from the server.",

Otherwise, the amount is converted from the source currency to the target currency using a service class called `CurrencyConverterService`. The converted amount is then returned as the response entity.\n* Support for conversion of currencies based on predefined exchange rates. This functionality would be implemented in the hypothetical `CurrencyConverterService` class, which could use Quarkus' dependency injection features to allow it to be injected into the resource classes without needing to create an instance of it directly in the code.\n* Support for conversion of currencies between different denominations, such as converting 1 USD to 1 EUR or 100 INR to 1 USD.\n* Support for conversion of currencies between different countries and regions, such as converting 1 USD to 1 CAD or 1 AUD.\n* Support for conversion of currencies in real-time, with up-to-date exchange rates and conversion rates based on the current market conditions.\n* Support for conversion of currencies in batch mode, where multiple amounts can be converted simultaneously.\n* Support for handling of invalid or missing input parameters, such as null or empty values for amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency, or any other required parameters.\n* Support for returning an error response with status code 400 (Bad Request) if any of the required parameters is missing or invalid.\n* Support for returning a success response with status code 200 (OK) and the converted amount as the response entity in case of successful conversion.\n* Support for handling of exceptions that may occur during currency conversion, such as network errors, exchange rate API failures, or other unexpected issues.\n* Support for returning an error response with status code 500 (Internal Server Error) if any exception occurs during currency conversion.",
