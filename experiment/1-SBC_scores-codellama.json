The API shall accept the principal amount (P), interest rate (r), time (t), and number of times interest is compounded per year (n) as parameters, and return the compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after interest.",
        "reverse_generated_requirement": "The system shall provide a RESTful API endpoint at `/calculateInterest` that accepts four parameters: `principalAmount`, `interestRate`, `timePeriod`, and `compoundingFrequency`. The API shall return the amount after interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt).\n\nThe system shall support the following functionality:\n\n* Calculate compound interest for a given principal, rate, and time period\n* Return the result in JSON format with the following schema: `{ \"interest\": <amount after interest> }`\n* Support input validation to ensure that all required parameters are present and of the correct data type\n* Provide descriptive error messages for any invalid inputs or exceptions thrown during calculation\n* Implement reactive programming features for handling HTTP requests asynchronously\n* Use Quarkus' dependency injection feature to inject an instance of the `InterestService` class into the `CalculateInterestResource` class\n\nThe system shall also provide a user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with the API endpoint. The UI shall include the following features:\n\n* A form to input the required parameters for calculating compound interest\n* A button to submit the form and initiate the calculation\n* Display the result of the calculation in JSON format, including any errors or exceptions\n* Provide an option to clear the form and start a new calculation\n* Use responsive design to ensure that the UI is accessible and usable on different devices and screen sizes.",
