1. User authentication and authorization: The code does not include any mechanism for authenticating users or authorizing access to certain features based on user roles. This is important to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data and perform actions that require elevated privileges.
2. Data validation: The code does not validate user input before submitting it to the server, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection attacks. It's important to validate all user input to prevent malicious activity and ensure that only valid data is being sent to the server.
3. Error handling: The code does not handle errors gracefully. If an error occurs while submitting data to the server, it could cause a break in the application or expose sensitive information to the user. It's important to handle errors and provide clear feedback to users to prevent unexpected behavior.
4. Performance optimization: The code does not optimize performance by using caching, lazy loading, or other techniques that can improve page load times and reduce server load. This is important to ensure that the application performs well under high traffic conditions and provides a good user experience.
5. Code organization: The code is not organized in a modular fashion, which could make it difficult to maintain and scale as the application grows. It's important to break up large files into smaller, more manageable components to ensure that the code remains maintainable over time.
6. Security best practices: The code does not follow security best practices such as using secure protocols (HTTPS), avoiding hard-coded credentials, and encrypting sensitive data at rest and in transit. It's important to implement these practices to protect against unauthorized access and ensure that the application is secure.

4. The `RemovePetConfirmationDialogComponent` class provides a confirmation dialog for deleting pets. It uses the `MatDialog` service to open a modal window with the confirmation message.
5. The application's routing is defined in the `app-routing.module.ts` file, which includes routes for navigating between pages and components.

To do this, they must make a POST request to the `/currency/convert` endpoint, passing in the following parameters: `amount`, `fromCurrency`, and `toCurrency`. The response will contain the converted amount based on the predefined exchange rates.
