The API shall accept the principal amount (P), interest rate (r), time (t), and number of times interest is compounded per year (n) as parameters, and return the compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after interest.",

The user interface for this functionality should include input fields for all these parameters. After entering valid inputs, the system shall provide the calculated compound interest as output.\n\n   The system should validate the input values to ensure they meet certain criteria: the principal amount must be positive, the rate must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1, the time period cannot be negative, and the compounding frequency must be a positive integer. If any of these validation checks fail, the system shall return an error message to guide the user towards providing valid input.",
