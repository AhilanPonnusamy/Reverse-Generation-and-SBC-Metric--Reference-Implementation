Use a state management library like `ngrx` or `ngxs` to handle the storing of the pet data and the passing of that data between components in your application. This will help you manage the complexity of your application and make it easier to maintain.\n2. Consider using a routing library like `ng-route` or `ng-router` to manage the navigation between different pages in your application. This will allow you to create more complex views and handle user input better.\n3. Use a data binding library like `AngularJS` or `React` to bind your pet data to the view. This will allow you to update the view automatically when the data changes, without having to manually update it every time the data changes.\n4. Consider using a testing framework like `Jasmine` or `Mocha` to write unit tests for your application. This will help you ensure that your application works as expected and catch any bugs early on.\n5. Use a build tool like `Webpack` or `Rollup` to manage the compilation of your code and the creation of your distributable files. This will make it easier to deploy your application in production and manage its dependencies.\n6. Consider using a linting tool like `ESLint` or `TSLint` to check your code for errors and enforce coding conventions. This will help you write better code and catch any potential bugs early on.\n7. Use a version control system like `Git` to manage the changes made to your application over time. This will allow you to collaborate with other developers, roll back changes if necessary, and easily track the history of your application.",

        "reverse_generated_requirement": "The provided code appears to be a RESTful API for converting amounts between currencies using Spring Boot. Here is a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. The `CurrencyConverter` interface defines the methods that will be used to convert amounts between currencies. This interface will be implemented by the `CurrencyConverterImpl` class, which contains the actual implementation of the currency conversion logic.\n2. The `ExchangeRateService` interface defines the methods that will be used to retrieve exchange rates for different currencies. This interface will be implemented by the `ExchangeRateServiceImpl` class, which contains the actual implementation of the exchange rate retrieval logic.\n3. The `ConvertDTO` class is a Spring data transfer object (DTO) that contains the information needed to convert amounts between currencies. It has three fields: `amount`, `sourceCurrencyCode`, and `targetCurrencyCode`. These fields are annotated with `@Data` to indicate that they should be treated as simple data containers, rather than entities with their own lifecycle management.\n4. The `CurrencyConverterController` class is a Spring controller that provides an implementation of the `CurrencyConverterController` interface. It contains a single method, `convert`, which takes in a `ConvertDTO` object and uses it to convert amounts between currencies using the `currencyConverter` field, which is injected with an instance of the `CurrencyConverter` interface using Spring's dependency injection mechanism.\n5. The `CurrencyConverterConfig` class is a Spring configuration that provides an implementation of the `ExchangeRateService` interface. It contains a single method, `exchangeRateService`, which creates a new instance of the `ExchangeRateServiceImpl` class and returns it as a bean. This bean will be used by the `CurrencyConverterController` to retrieve exchange rates for different currencies.\n\nOverall, this code appears to be an example of how to create a RESTful API for converting amounts between currencies using Spring Boot. The interface-based design allows for easy extension and testing of the currency conversion logic, while the data transfer objects (DTOs) provide a clear and simple way to represent the information needed for currency conversions.",
