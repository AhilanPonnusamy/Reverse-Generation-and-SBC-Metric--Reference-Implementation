A form for adding new family members, which is implemented using the `AddFamilyMemberComponent`. This component contains input fields for the name, age, gender, and relationship of the family member, as well as a button to submit the form. When the form is submitted, it calls the `addFamilyMember()` method in the `FamilyMemberService` to create a new family member object with the entered values.\n2. A list of all family members, which is implemented using the `FamilyMembersListComponent`. This component uses the `familyMembers$` observable provided by the `FamilyMemberService` to display a list of all family members. Each family member in the list has an edit button that, when clicked, calls the `editFamilyMember()` method in the `FamilyMemberService` to update the existing family member object with the new values.\n3. A form for editing existing family members, which is implemented using the `EditFamilyMemberComponent`. This component contains input fields for the name, age, gender, and relationship of the family member, as well as a button to submit the form. When the form is submitted, it calls the `editFamilyMember()` method in the `FamilyMemberService` to update the existing family member object with the new values.\n4. A message indicating whether the update was successful or not, which is implemented using the `SuccessMessageComponent`. This component uses the `familyMembersUpdated$` observable provided by the `FamilyMemberService` to display a success message when an update is made to any family member.\n\nThe `FamilyMemberService` is responsible for making HTTP requests to the API, while the `FamilyMemberModel` provides a class that represents each family member object. The service uses the Angular `HttpClient` module to make GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the API, and it returns observables of family members.\n\nOverall, this is a basic example of how to create a CRUD application in Angular that uses an API as the data source. You can build upon this example to add more functionality or customize the user interface to fit your needs.",

The server should be able to handle requests and responses efficiently and provide a robust security framework.\n* A web browser or other client software that can render the user interface (UI) of the application and interact with the server through the APIs. The UI should be responsive, intuitive, and easy to use.\n* An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that can map the entities defined in the code to the database tables and vice versa. The ORM should provide efficient data retrieval and manipulation operations, as well as support for complex relationships between entities.\n* A templating engine that can generate HTML views from templates based on the data received from the server. The templating engine should be able to handle multiple layouts, themes, and styles, and allow developers to create customizable components.\n* A build tool (such as Webpack or Rollup) that can bundle the application code into a deployable format, including all necessary dependencies and assets. The build tool should provide optimized performance and minimized output file sizes.\n\nThe system shall also be designed with scalability and maintainability in mind. It should be easy to add new entities, attributes, and relationships to the database schema without affecting existing functionality. Additionally, the code should be modular and organized, allowing developers to easily locate and modify specific parts of the application as needed.\n\nThe system shall provide a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and deleting suppliers and products. The UI should include fields for entering supplier details (name, contact information, rating), product details (supplier reference, name, SKU, price, stock), and options to search, sort, and filter the data.\n\nThe system shall also provide a dashboard that displays key metrics and insights about the suppliers and products in the database. The dashboard should include charts and graphs to visualize trends and patterns in the data, as well as statistics on the number of suppliers, products, and sales.",

The API endpoint shall support HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads containing amount, fromCurrencyCode, and toCurrencyCode parameters. The API endpoint shall return a plain text response with the converted amount.\n\nThe system shall use Quarkus' dependency injection mechanism to inject the `SecurityUtils` and `ExchangeRateService` objects into the class. This allows for easier testing and maintenance of the class, as well as ensuring that the dependencies are properly managed throughout the application lifecycle.\n\nThe system shall use the `securityUtils` object to check if the user has the necessary permissions to access the API endpoint. If the user does not have the correct role, the system shall return an HTTP 403 Forbidden status code. Otherwise, the system shall retrieve the exchange rate for the specified currencies from the `exchangeRateService` using the `getExchangeRate` method and calculate the converted amount. The system shall store the converted amount in a HashMap response object and return it as JSON in the HTTP response.",
